# odin-recipes
This is a website which lists three of my favorite recipes. Throughout the course of this project, I have:
- Created a repository in GitHub and cloned it to my machine
- Used CLI to make multiple directories, download and move images, and organize files within the Odin Recipes directory
- Wrote an index page and multiple recipe pages and linked them together using relative links
- Formatted recipe pages using attributes and anchors
- Used git to commit and push files to the repository
- Instituted best practice for formatting commit messages
